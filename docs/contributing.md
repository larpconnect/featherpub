# How to Contribute

At the moment the development is "open" more than it is "open source." The ultimate goal here is to release all of this and accept patches, etc but at the moment that documentation is a WIP and requires FeatherPub to be in a more finalized state.

Basically: This guide is coming and this project does aim to accept contributions, but it is not ready for such yet.
